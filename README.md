# ABCI++ Workshop

Joint workshop between [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/main) and [CometBFT](https://cometbft.com/) for [Hackmos](https://cosmoverse.org/hackmos) at [Cosmoverse](https://cosmoverse.org/).

Supported by [Informal Systems](https://informal.systems/) and [Binary Builders](https://binary.builders/).

## Concepts
**Overview**

The goal of this workshop is to demonstrate to developers how they might think about utilizing ABCI++ and new features in the Eden release of the Cosmos SDK.

In part 1, we explore the application and discuss a potential vector for MEV by leveraging custom block building in `PreparePropsoal` for a chain running perpetual nameservice auctions.

In part 2 and 3, we build a solution to mitigate auction front running by extending functionality in `ExtendVote`, `PrepareProposal`, and `ProcessProposal`. This solution assumes an honest 2/3 majority of validators are not colluding to front run transactions.

At **H-1** during `ExtendVote`, we check the mempool for unconfirmed transactions and select all auction bids. Validators submit their Vote Extension with a list of all bids available in their mempool. 
Additionally we implement a custom app side `ThresholdMempool`, which guarantees that transactions can only be included in a proposal if they have been seen by `ExtendVote` at H-1.

At **H** during `PrepareProposal`, the validator will process all bids included in Vote Extensions from H-1. It will inject this result into a Special Transaction to be included in the proposal.
During the subsequent `ProcessProposal`, validators will check if there are any bid transactions. Bids included in the proposal will be validated against the bids included in the Special Transaction.
If a bid included in the proposal does not meet the minimum threshold of inclusion frequency in Vote Extensions from H-1, the proposal is rejected.

## Developing

### Setup

**Dependencies**
- [Go 1.21](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [Jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)

#### Start A Single Chain
> Note: Running the provider on a single chain will affect liveness. To run the provider safely on a single node, checkout the `part-1-2` branch.
```
make start-localnet

jq '.consensus.params.abci.vote_extensions_enable_height = "2"' ~/.cosmappd/config/genesis.json > output.json && mv output.json ~/.cosmappd/config/genesis.json

./build/cosmappd start --val-key val1 --run-provider false
```

#### Start a 3 Validator Network

Make sure to run `make build`

```shell
./scripts/configure.sh
```

Read Logs
```shell

tail -f $HOME/cosmos/nodes/beacon/logs
tail -f $HOME/cosmos/nodes/val1/logs
tail -f $HOME/cosmos/nodes/val1/logs

```

Query a node
```shell
./scripts/query-beacon-status.sh
```

List Available User Keys
```shell
./scripts/list-beacon-keys.sh
```

### Demo

> **Vote Extensions** are enabled from Height 2, so make sure not to submit transactions until H+1 has been comitted.

#### 3 Validator Network
In the 3 validator network, the Beacon validator has a custom transaction provider enabled.
It might take a few tries before the transaction is picked up and front ran by the Beacon.

After submitting the following transaction, we should be able to see the proposal accepted or rejected in the logs.
Note that it is best to submit the transaction after the Beacon has just proposed a successful proposal.
```shell
./scripts/reserve.sh "bob.cosmos"
```
Query to verify the name has been reserved
```shell
./scripts/whois.sh "bob.cosmos"
```
If the Beacon attempts to front run the bid, we will see the following logs during `ProcessProposal`
```shell
2:47PM ERR ❌️:: Detected invalid proposal bid :: name:"bob.cosmos" resolveAddress:"cosmos1wmuwv38pdur63zw04t0c78r2a8dyt08hf9tpvd" owner:"cosmos1wmuwv38pdur63zw04t0c78r2a8dyt08hf9tpvd" amount:<denom:"uatom" amount:"2000" >  module=server
2:47PM ERR ❌️:: Unable to validate bids in Process Proposal :: <nil> module=server
2:47PM ERR prevote step: state machine rejected a proposed block; this should not happen:the proposer may be misbehaving; prevoting nil err=null height=142 module=consensus round=0
```

#### Single Node
```shell
./build/cosmappd tx ns reserve "bob.cosmos" $(./build/cosmappd keys show alice -a --keyring-backend test) 1000uatom --from $(./build/cosmappd keys show bob -a --keyring-backend test) -y
```
Query to verify the name has been reserved
```shell
./build/cosmappd q ns whois "bob.cosmos" -o json
```
